- 🔭 I’m currently working on my **ALX intro to SE course**

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Implement a web design from scratch**
<h2 align="left">Project Objectives</h2>
<p align="left">In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.
<br>
You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.</p>

<h2 align="left">Project Requirements</h2>

- you are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
- you are not to use Javascript
